# project-ironhero

Introduction

This is the first of the projects I am doing during the fullstack web developement Bootcamp.

What is it about?

"Ironhero" and the tale of the Ironprincess is game based on jQuery DOM manipulation. The goal is to make it through a maze, defeat the endboss and rescue the Ironprinces within a certain timelimit. 

While the player is exploring the maze he can collect items, explore hidden chambers and interact with npcs.
