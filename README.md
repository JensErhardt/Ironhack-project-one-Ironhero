<h1>Ironhero and the tale of the Ironprincess - Ironhack project #1</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is the first of three projects I did during the Ironhack fullstack web developement bootcamp in Berlin.

<h2>What's the game about?</h2>

Ironhero and the tale of the Ironprincess is a brwoser rendered 2D topview game based on DOM manipulation with jQuery. The goal is to make it through a maze, defeat the endboss and rescue the Ironprincess within a given timelimit. 

The game offers various features, such as:

- Rescue a princess
- Fight an endboss
- Explore the dungeon
- Hunt for items
- Interact with NPCs
- Collect a dragon as pet
- music and voice

<h2>Technologies used</h2>

In order to set up the DOM-structure I used HTML 5 and to give it a view I used CSS 3. For The gamelogic I used Javascript und for the manipulation of the DOM I used jQuery.
