# project-ironhero

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is the first of three projects I am doing during the Ironhack fullstack web developement bootcamp in Berlin.

<h2>What's the game about?</h2>

"Ironhero" and the tale of the Ironprincess is a game based on DOM manipulation with jQuery. The goal is to make it through a maze, defeat the endboss and rescue the Ironprinces within a certain timelimit. 

While the player explores the maze he can collect items, explore hidden chambers and interact with npcs.
